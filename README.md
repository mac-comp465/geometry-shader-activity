# Drawing normals with geometry shaders

In this activity, you will practice using shaders to create geometry

## Getting Started

Clone and generate the project files:

```
cd yourCodeDirectory
git clone https://github.com/mac-comp465/geometry-shader-activity
cd geometry-shader-activity
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
```

## To Do

Modify normals.geom to create normals for each vertex
